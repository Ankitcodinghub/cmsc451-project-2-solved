Project 2 involves writing an analysis of the results that you obtained in first project. You are to submit a paper that discusses the results of your analysis. Your paper should include the following items:

• A brief introduction of the sorting algorithm that you have selected and how the two versions of the algorithm compare including:

o High-level pseudocode for the sorting algorithms o A Big-Θ analysis of the two versions of the algorithm

o An explanation of your approach to avoiding the problems associated with JVM warm-up

o A discussion of the critical operation that you chose to count with an explanation of why you selected it

• An analysis of the results of your study, which should include:

o graph of critical operations for both algorithms and one for the execution times o a comparison of the performance of the two versions of the algorithm o a comparison of the critical operation results and the actual execution time measurements

o a discussion of the significance of the coefficient of variance results and how it reflects the data sensitivity of your algorithm

o how your results compare to your Big-Θ analysis

• A conclusion that summarizes the important observations of your study

If for any reason, it was necessary to revise the program you submitted in project 1, the revised source code should also be included along with the paper.
